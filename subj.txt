	∗ Do you wonder what a CGI is?
	∗ Because you won’t call the CGI directly, use the full path as PATH_INFO.
	∗ Just remember that, for chunked request, your server needs to unchunked
	it and the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body.
	∗ Same things for the output of the CGI. If no content_length is returned
	from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.
	∗ Your program should call the CGI with the file requested as first argument.
	∗ The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.
	∗ Your server should work with one CGI (php-CGI, Python, and so forth).
You must provide some configuration files and default basic files to test and demonstrate every feature works during evaluation.
